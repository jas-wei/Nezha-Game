# Nezha

A 2D game built in Godot that reimagines the birth of Nezha through the lens of traditional Chinese shadow puppetry.

## About

This project blends cultural storytelling with modern tools. Inspired by shadow puppet theater, the game uses silhouette-based characters projected onto textured paper backgrounds to evoke a handcrafted feel. The story follows Nezhaâ€™s mythical origin, combining visual style with narrative flow.

## Features

- Shadow puppetry aesthetic using physically projected silhouettes and paper textures
- Fully handcrafted assets: visuals, animation, sound, and music
- Narrative-driven gameplay rooted in Chinese mythology
- Solo-developed using the Godot engine

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
3. Press **Play** to launch the game.

(Note: The game will not appear exactly as shown in presentation photos or videos due to missing background assets. The original backgrounds were physically projected and intended for in-person display.)
